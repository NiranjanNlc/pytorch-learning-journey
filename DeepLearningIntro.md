# Machine Learning vs Deep Learning

## Overview
While discussing machine learning and deep learning, we can infer that deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Both are used for learning from data.

## Key Differences

### Data Structure Requirements
- **Machine Learning**: Explicitly used for structured data like Excel sheets
- **Deep Learning**: Particularly used for unstructured data

### Learning Process
During machine learning, the system tries to connect patterns between input and output.

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Input Conversion**: First, all input is converted into numerical format, which is also referred to as a tensor
2. **Neural Network Processing**: This tensor is fed into the neural network. This neural network gets updated and developed when more and more data is trained into it
3. **Output Generation**: This neural network also produces output in numerical format, referred to as a tensor
4. **Final Conversion**: That tensor is ultimately converted into the final output

## Learning Paradigms
Two learning paradigms are commonly used:
- **Supervised Learning**: Uses labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Uses unlabeled data

Though the names are self-explanatory, supervised learning is performed on data with labels, while unsupervised learning lacks labeled data.

## Additional Learning Types
Another type of learning is **Reinforcement Learning**, where neural networks learn through the virtue of rewards and punishment.

## Applications
Deep learning can be and has been used in almost everything, including:
- Recommendation systems
- Language translation
- Prediction
- And many more applications

## When to Use Machine Learning?

It is wise to know where **not** to use deep learning:

- Simple rule-based systems can solve the problem
- There is not enough data to infer patterns
- There is no room for error, since deep learning is probabilistic in nature

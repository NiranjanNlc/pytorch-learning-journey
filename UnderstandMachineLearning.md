# My Understanding of Machine Learning

## Traditional Programming vs. Machine Learning
- **Traditional Programming**: Maps inputs to outputs through explicitly defined rules. For example, a calculator uses predefined arithmetic rules to compute results.
- **Challenge**: When the rules are too complex or impractical to define manually, traditional programming becomes infeasible.

## Role of Machine Learning
- **Purpose**: Machine learning (ML) addresses scenarios where explicit rules are difficult to formulate. It constructs a model that learns patterns or "rules" from given inputs and outputs.
- **Process**: ML takes predefined input-output pairs to infer the underlying mapping that would produce the outputs from the inputs.
- **Example**: In self-driving cars, ML learns to map sensor data (e.g., distance to obstacles, speed) to actions (e.g., brake, steer) by analyzing large datasets, as opposed to relying on a rule-based system which cannot handle the complexity of driving scenarios.

# Why Use Machine Learning

## Limitations of Rule-Based Systems
- Rule-based systems work well for simple, deterministic tasks like a calculator, where inputs (e.g., `2 + 3`) map to outputs (`5`) using predefined rules.
- However, rule-based systems fail when the input-output mapping is complex or involves many variables, making it impractical to define explicit rules.

## Machine Learning for Complex Systems
- Machine learning (ML) is used when there are clear inputs and outputs, but the relationship between them is complex or unknown.
- **Example**: In a driving system, inputs like speed, obstacles, traffic signals, and other factors vary widely. ML learns to map these inputs to outputs (e.g., brake, steer) by analyzing large datasets.
- ML excels in handling diverse and dynamic conditions where rule-based systems cannot capture all possible scenarios.

## Gaining Insights from Data
- ML is used to uncover patterns in large, complex datasets when the "how" or "why" behind the input-output relationship is unclear.
- It provides insights by learning from data, enabling predictions or decisions in scenarios like autonomous driving, where manual rule creation is infeasible.
